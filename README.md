# Mini-project-node
This is the mini-project that I contributed to when I was in the week 8 of my time at Decagon.

# Technologies
 *  MongoDB and Mongoose
 * Express.js
 * TypeScript
 * Node.js
* React.js

# We are building this Year Book App to be a resource that all DECADEVS can fall back to in order to get in-touch with his or her sqaud or stack member; any time; any day.
